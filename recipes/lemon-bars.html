    <h1>Lemon Bars</h1>

    <h2>Light and Breezy Treat</h2>
    <p>These lemon bars remind me of the lemon bars my mom used to make. They have just the right bit of tang and sweetness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.</li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.</li>
    </ol>
